A user-friendly interface designed for interacting with the ML model (https://github.com/Tim-cryptow/hotel_cancellation_prediction)
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
This project is currently deployed on Vercel. You can access it on: https://predictor-frontend-phi.vercel.app/

## Getting Started

Visit https://predictor-frontend-phi.vercel.app/, Input the Lead_time, Average_Daily_Rate (ADR), Total Special Request, Deposit Type and the Country Code of the customer.
The model will return either "Likely to Cancle" or "Not Likely to Cancel" depending on the likelihood of the customer cancelling the booking.

This will help hotel managers and staffs to better manage resources and prevent loss of potential revenue.
